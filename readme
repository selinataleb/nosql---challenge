Module 12 Challenge 

Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up

Using SQL_setup_starter folder 

We began by importing the dataset and importing dependencies 
We then created an instance of MongoClient and confirmed that our new database was created. 
We confirmed that uk_food was listed and we assigned it to a new variable name db
We then reviewed the collections in our new database and assigned that to a variable called establishments. 

Part 2: Update the Database 

We added Penang Flavours to our list of restaurants, and we inserted it into the collection. 
We made sure that the new restaurant was added 
We also deleted any establishment within the Dover Local Authority because the magazine is not interested in those establihsments. 

Part 3: Exploratory Analysis 

These questions have been answered in the Jupyter Notebook called NoSQL_analysis_starter 

Question 1: Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
Question 2: Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"? 
Question 4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
